This is a project that myself and the others listed above worked on together as part of our Software Engineering class at UTSA during Fall 2024. The ultimate idea behind this project was for us to learn and practice the AGILE methodology, and not so much to actually make anything. I could say more about that, but that isn't relevant, so I won't.

Explanation:

As part of our Software Engineering class, we were assigned into groups, and made to work on a semester long project together. As part of the software development process, we had to brainstorm ideas for applications that we could feasibly make, then collect data and requirements from other people in the class in order to better build our chosen idea.

What my group ultimately settled on was developing a car rental application for Android OS devices. With regards to the AGILE process itself, we had to plan out the project development across four sprints, each about 2 to 3 weeks in length, and try our best to employ various AGILE practices in that time. As the others would likely tell if you asked them, we couldn't make the AGILE methodology work for us, so we largely ignored it until it was required for an assignment or deliverable. This largely came down to time constraints as a result of other assignments in the class, or projects from other classes. I'll say that I can see how it could work in a professional setting, but it was not appropriate for an academic setting, at least with our circumstances.

Anyways, we designed the car rental application, and even got some basic functionality in, such as creating an account, and logging into the app. I myself even personally designed and implemented a SQLite database, alongside a variety of Java methods for reading and writing data from and to the database. Now, storing that database on the user's phone probably isn't the best idea, but I figured it was fine given the relatively limited scope of the project.

At the end of the day, it may not be much, but we did learn a lot.
